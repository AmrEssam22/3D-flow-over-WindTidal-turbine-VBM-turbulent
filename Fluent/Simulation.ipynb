    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "** The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions. **\n",

It should be noted that the path for defining conditions and other settings are provided in `command line` format. Users can access exact same settings and options by following the provided path via the tree of progress or pull down menu in ANSYS FLUENT. The summary of the steps to take for CFD simulation setup for problem of 2D laminar flow over a flat plate are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Following is the step-by-step explanation for each of the above command/setting procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "* In the majority problems of flow over a turbine it is assumed the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop the CFD simulation: <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/models/steady</span>. It is important to note that since VBM averages the effect of rotating blades and the assigned rotational speed of the turbine is defined to be constant, by default all the case studies that use the VBM should be run in steady mode, unless the model User Defined Functions (UDFs) are modified for unsteady implementation. In those cases the selected model for simulation setup will still be viscous, however the appropriate transient model should be selected at this step. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In this problem we are considering that the flow is in subsonic regime. Therefore, variation of density with respect to the pressure can be neglected. As a result of this assumption one can define the working fluid to be incompressible: <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/models/solver/pressure-based</span>. In cases that the speed of the flow enters sonic and supersonic regimes ( Mach # > 0.3 ), the changes in density (i.e. compressibility) of the flow will be an important factor and the solver must be defined as density-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For majority of full scale turbine the flow field Reynolds number, based on the turbine's mean chord length has large order of magnitudes, which makes the flow turbulent. In the current problem the flow field Reynolds number, based on the turbine's 1 [m] chord length, is about $10^6$. Thus, this flow field is also fully turbulent and the suitable turbulent (closure) model should be selected. The selection of the turbulent model is strongly a function of application and Reynolds number of the problem. Based on these two factors a suitable model should be selected. In case users don't have the sufficient background for this selection it is highly recommended to perform an in-depth research and learn more about previous CFD works on their application of interest, instead of blindly iterating between different closure models. For this specific case study [Javaherchi et. al.](http://wie.sagepub.com/content/38/2/181.short) [1] proved that the Spalart-Allmaras is a suitable model for this flow field and application. User can select this model via path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/models/viscous/spalart-allmaras</span>. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last step for to setup the required models for this case study is enabling the VBM model inside ANSYS FLUENT. VBM is a set of User Defined Functions (UDFs) that was developed in C language for the use in ANSYS FLUENT and can be integrated with other available models and solvers in this CFD commercial package. The general framwork of this algorithm was first published by [Zori et. al.]() [2]. The required UDF files are available in the Simulation_Src directory. User are recommended to download them and follow the two steps below to compile them and enable the VBM model in ANSYS FLUENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1) Using the path <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/user-defined/compiled-functions/compiled-functions</span> select the two sources script files `rotor_model_v10.1.c` and `thread_mem_v1.0.c` along with the header file `thread_mem.h`. Then build and load them up inside ANSYS FLUENT. This process will create a local directory named `libudf` on your local machine to read and write data from. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2) Using the path <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/file/read/scheme</span> from the top drop-down menu read the `rotor_model_v10.scm` file. After reading this file the name of the `Virtual Blade Model` will appear among the list of available models inside ANSYS FLUENT in `Off` mode. Double click on this name will open the rotor panel window and turn the model `On`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1 Setup VBM Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After compiling the Virtual Blade Model (VBM) UDFs into ANSYS FLUENT, when the user opens the VBM panel a new window called `Rotor Inputs` will be opened. This panel is the place that user provides both geometrical information of the turbine and desired blade section to be simulated via VBM. Fig. 1 shows the `Rotor Input` panel. This panel has three tabs: `General`, `Geometry` and `Triming`. The `Triming` tab can be enables by choosing the `Triming` option on top of the tab. However it is not useful for the simulation of horizontal axis wind or tidal turbine and should remain disabled. In the following two sub-sections the description for each of the required inputs in the `General` and `Geometry` tabs are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/rotor_inputs_panel.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Fig. 1 - The Virtual Blade Model (VBM) Rotor Inputs panel and it's two tabs, filled with the geometrical information of the NREL Phase VI two bladed wind turbine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the description on the required inputs of the `General` tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Number of Blades`: The number of the turbine blade/s. The NREL Phase VI is two bladed wind turbine, thus the input here is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotor Radius`: The radius of the turbine blade. The NREL Phase VI turbine radius is 5.53 [m].\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotor Speed`: The angular speed of the turbine rotor blade/s. Most of the time users know the desired Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) that the turbine would operate under. This input can be calculated based on the definition of TSR and knowing the mean value of streamwise flow speed. If the user input has a different units, the default units can be changed using the path `\\define\\units [angular-velocity]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Tip Effect`: The VBM in inherently a 2D model, based on the Blade Element Theory. Considering that the flow field close to the blade tip due to the maximum total velocity, vector summation of incoming flow velocity and turbine angular velocity, becomes highly 3D a correction is needed for a more accurate estimated of the flow field in this region. This correction will be implemented for the remaining specified percentage of the blade span stated by user. Meaning that recommended input of 96 [%] will apply the correction to the estimated lift and drag coefficients (forces) values at the last 4 [%] of the blade span.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotor Disk Origin`: The EXACT cartesian coordinates of the defined rotor face created in the CFD domain. Users were instructed how to create this full 360 [deg] circle as the rotor face. They were also advised to write it's center coordinates down during the geometry and mesh generation of the CFD domain. It is highly recommended to input to EXACT values from the geometry of the CFD domain. Otherwise error might occur in next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotor Face Zone`: The name of the pre-defined, full 360 [deg] circle, as the rotor face created in the CFD domain step should be selected/highlighted from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotor Disk`: This section takes geometrical angles for the turbine's `Rotor Disk`. Usually for wind and tidal turbines rotor disk (not the turbine blade) has zero `Pitch Angle`. Meaning that the rotor disk of turbine is perpendicular to the streamwise flow. The `Bank Angle`, on the other hand, defines the orientation of the rotor disk. By default VBM takes the initial orientation of the rotor disk's axis of rotation to be aligned with the positive $z$-axis (i.e. 0 [deg] `Bank Angle`). Fig. 2 visualizes the definition and positive orientation of rotor disk `Bank Angle` angle. In cases that the rotor's axis of rotation has an angle with positive $z$-axis, which is majority the case, the value should be input here. Note that, as shown in Fig. 2, the `Bank Angle` is mathematically positive around $x$-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/bank_angle.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "Fig. 2 - Visualization of the turbine Rotor Disk's Origin, Pitch Angle and Bank Angle as VBM's default. In case of NREL Phase VI the streamwise flow is in the negative $y$-axis, perpendicular to the upward $z$-axis. This geometrical orientation lead to Rotor Disk Bank Angle of 90 [deg].\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Blade Pitch`: Again for the wind and tidal turbine application the turbine blades are relatively stiff and their local pitch angle does not change as the blades rotate around their central axis of rotation, as opposed to helicopter blades. However, the entire turbine blade span usually has a `Collective pitch` angle, sometimes referred to as `Pitch` angle, relative to incoming flow. The role of this angle, in collaboration with local twist angle, is to moderate the value angle of attack distribution along the blade span from root to the tip. This value is constant and mostly fixed, unless the turbine is known to be variable pitch. The sign of this angle depends on the orientation of the define cartesian coordinates of the CFD domain (see Fig. 3). In case of having hard time figuring out the pitch blade sign, use the same sign for pitch (and twist angle in next tab), if power input was negative, showing you are modeling a propeller not a turbine, change the sign of pitch and twist angles in your inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/pitch_angle.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Fig. 3 - Visualization of the turbine blade Pitch and Twist Angles. In case of NREL Phase VI the streamwise flow is in the negative $y$-axis perpendicular to the upward $z$-axis. Thus, the pitch angle of the blade should have a negative sign, base on right hand rule, to extract momentum from the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Blade Flapping`: Again these angles don't apply to the simulation of rigid blades of wind and tidal turbines. So their input values will be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Followings are the description on the required inputs of the VBM's `Geometry` tab. In this tab user will input the geometrical specifications of up-to 20 sections along the blade span.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Number of Sections`: The number of sections that user desires to divide the blade span into from 1 to 20.\n",
    "* `Radius`: The radial position for the center of each blade section (r) normalized by the value of blade radius (R).\n",
    "* `Chord`: The mean value of the chord length between the top and bottom airfoils of the blade section.\n",
    "* `Twist`: The mean value of the twist angle between the top and bottom airfoils of the blade section (See Fig. 3 for definition and sign convention).\n",
    "* `File Name`: Name of the lookup lift and drag coefficients table as a function of angle of attack and type of the airfoil cross section. Fig. 4 visualizes the structure of this lookup table. Users should develop this table for each airfoil profile, following the same structure, save it with * .dat extension and put it in the working directory with the VBM UDFs to be used by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/lookup_table.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Fig. 4 - The data structure of the lift and drag coefficients lookup table. Users should prepare this files for their geometry of interest in a simple text editor save it with * .dat extension and put it in the working directory with the VBM UDFs to be used by the model. These data can be obtained from experiment, 3D simulations, 2D simulations or potential flow codes such as XFoil.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage the VBM model is setup completely. It is recommended to hit the Change/Create bottom once in a while to save the input data. VBM is a fragile UDF and can crash on users easily. It is recommended to save your .cas file as you make progress is setting up the model. It is worthwhile to note that if any of the inputs are wrong, VBM crashes the entire simulation with no meaningful error message! Thus significant amount of patient and carefulness is needed here!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:** (Add the required bullet points with details explanations. Keep the title but remove the color)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number based on blade mean chord length in this problem, to match the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the basis for expected physical observations. For this problem, however the working fluid is known to be air since the device of interest is a wind turbine. Users can use the path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/material/change-create/</span> and select `Air` from the material data base. In most of the CFD packages, air is defined is the default working fluid. Hence, users might not need to modify the working fluid via this menu at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* The flow interacts with the `Virtual Blades` replaced inside a rotor zone volume, created previously in the CFD domain. The averaged lift and drag forces estimated based on the Blade Element Theory, explained in physics section, are put on this volume zone as a sink of momentum in three (cartesian) directions. Users can put these sinks of momentum on this specified volume zone following the click-able path of <span style=style=\\\"background-color:lightgrey;\\\">Cell Zone Conditions -> [name] of the zone -> Edit... -> disable `Source Terms` option -> pick corresponding sink of momentum in $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ directions</span> as shown in Fig. 5. Please note that this path can be reached via clicks as opposed to command lines. Users should note to pick up the right and corresponding momentum sink direction and number from the list. The numbers represent the number/tag of the rotor zones. If a user desires to simulate the flow field and performance of an array of turbines, VBM handles up-to 20 rotor zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/sourceterms.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "Fig. 5 - The panel and procedure for a user to put the sink of the momentum on the created rotor zone volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this problem the entire CFD domain is filled with the defined working fluid. This working fluid is selected from the defined material/s in the previous step: <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/boundary-conditions/fluid</span>. For this problem users only need to assign the newly defined working fluid, the rest of the options remained unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity of 6.8 [m/s] in negative $y$-direction. User sets the velocity-inlet condition to the face named inlet by defining the direction and magnitude of the velocity: <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/boundary-conditions/velocity-inlet</span>. In cases where the incoming velocity into the CFD domain is not uniform, one can define the incoming velocity with the pre-defined directions or generate a User Define Function (UDF) to describe the velocity profile of interest. This modification comes handy when user will to investigate performance of the device in a sheared flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this problem the flow can exit the CFD domain from the outlet face and it's pressure will be equal to atmospheric pressure. User sets the pressure-outlet condition to these faces: <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/boundary-conditions/pressure-outlet</span>. This simulates the physics of the problem of flow over a cylinder. Thus, it is assumed that gauge pressure at this boundary is equal to 0. If in the problem of interest there exists a specific pressure difference between the inlet and outlet or other surfaces, that magnitude can be defined in corresponding faces of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The flow around the turbine is bounded by with a cylindrical surface of the CFD domain. This cylindrical face interacts with the flow field based on a (free)-slip wall boundary condition. The wall boundary condition would limit and define the bounds of the flow field. However, since a high resolution mesh is not provided to capture the boundary layer close to this wall region the (free)-slip condition as opposed to no-slip is imposed as an option of wall boundary condition on this region. When applying this wall boundary condition it is important to consider that the value of the turbine blockage ratio, defined as ratio of turbine blade swept area over inlet area. For the case of NREL Phase VI turbine the blockage ratio is being matched by the defined value in a higher fidelity simulations as explained in [1]. In cases that blockage effect would be a concern either the geometry of the CFD domain should be modified or this boundary condition should be replaced with another type (symmetry). User assign the wall boundary condition to the face of the cylindrical shell of the CFD domain named `outer-wall` via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">/define/boundary-conditions/wall</span> command and choose the `slip` option. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution methods:** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, it is highly recommended to use the default options and settings, unless based on physics of the problem the user is aware of any specific choices. Upon non-smooth convergence and potential divergence of the CFD simulation user can modify and examine various solution methods. In case of available experimental data to validate the CFD simulations user can perform a logical trial and error between different choices. The recommended numerical settings and discretization for flow field simulation around the NREL Phase VI wind turbine are shown in Table 1. Users can change the settings for different scheme using the path <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">solve/set/discretization-scheme</span>\n",
